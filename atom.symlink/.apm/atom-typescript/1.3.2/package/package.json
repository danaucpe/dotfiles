No `grunt` no `Visual Studio`. Just pure coding.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install [atom](https://atom.io).\n2. `apm install atom-typescript` (`apm` needs `git` in your path)\n3. Fire up atom. Wait for the message: `AtomTS: Dependencies installed correctly. Enjoy TypeScript â™¥` **It may take up to 5 minutes for this message to appear. Be patient!**\n\n**Additional Notes**: [Some packages we love](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/blob/master/docs/packages.md).\n\n## Reviews\n\"I was shocked at how good it felt to poke around on the compiler with it.\" [Jonathan Turner](https://twitter.com/jntrnr)  \n\"And guess what, it worked perfectly. Like everything else! Faster than Visual Studio!\" [Daniel Earwicker](http://stackoverflow.com/users/27423/daniel-earwicker)  \n\"It's a thing of beauty - they had me at '*Type information on hover*'. Discovering  `tsconfig.json` support as well was just an enormous bonus.\" [John Reilly](https://twitter.com/johnny_reilly)  \n\"This may be your best option for editing TypeScript at the moment - very nice!\" [Rasmus Schultz](https://twitter.com/mindplaydk)\n\n[*Add yours!*](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/issues/66)\n\n# Features\n## Auto Complete\nInternally using AutoComplete+. Just start typing and hints will show up. Or you can explicitly trigger it using `ctrl+space` or `cmd+space`. Press `tab` to make a selection.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript-examples/master/screens/fastErrorCheckingAndAutoComplete2.gif)\n\n\n## Type information on hover\nJust hover\n\n![you definitely get the point](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/master/docs/screens/hover.png)\n\n## Compile on save\nTypeScript files will be compiled on save. Different notifications are given if `emit` was successful or not. [Configuration driven by `tsconfig.json`](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/blob/master/docs/tsconfig.md)\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/master/docs/screens/compile%20success.png)\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/master/docs/screens/compile%20error.png)\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/master/docs/screens/emit%20error.png)\n\n## Project Support\nSupported via `tsconfig.json` ([read more](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/blob/master/docs/tsconfig.md)) which is going to be the defacto Project file format for the next versions of TypeScript.\n\nIt also supports `filesGlob` which will expand `files` for you based on `minmatch|glob|regex` (similar to grunt).\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/master/docs/screens/proj.png)\n\n### Project Build Support\nShortcut: `ctrl+shift+b` or `cmd+shift+b`. If there are any errors they are shown as well.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/master/docs/screens/build%20success.png)\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/master/docs/screens/build%20errors.png)\n\n## Format Code\nShortcut : `ctrl+alt+l` or `cmd+alt+l`. Will format just the selection if you have something selected otherwise it will format the entire file.\n\n## Go to Declaration\nShortcut : `ctrl+b` or `cmd+b`. Will open the *first* declaration of the said item for now. (Note: some people call it Go to Definition)\n\n## Block Comment and Uncomment\n`ctrl+/` or `cmd+/`. Does a block comment / uncomment of code.\n\n## Refactoring\n\n### Rename\n`f2` to initiate rename. `enter` to commit and `esc` to cancel.\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/master/docs/screens/renameRefactoring.png)\n\n## tsconfig validation\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript-examples/master/errorcases/invalidProjectOptions/invalidProjectOptions.gif)\n\n## Snippets\n### Relative Paths\nRelative paths have traditionally been a pain, not anymore. Use `import` or `ref` and press `tab` to trigger snippet.\n\n`ref`\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript-examples/master/screens/ref%20snippet.gif)\n\n`import`\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript-examples/master/screens/import%20snippet.gif)\n\nNote that within the path string you get autocomplete (`ctrl+space`/`cmd+space`) for all the files in the project by filename (works for both `ref` and `import`).\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript-examples/master/screens/pathChange.gif)\n\n## Contributing\n\nLook at [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for curiosity. We work hard to keep the code as approachable as possible and are highly keen on helping you help us.\n\n## Changelog\nBreaking changes [available online](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/blob/master/docs/CHANGELOG.md).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"atom-typescript@1.3.2","_shasum":"1ae813b666509ed294f3e6f515a88dbac87467ff","_resolved":"file:../d-115219-21811-14ucn32/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115219-21811-14ucn32/package.tgz"}
